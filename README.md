The Ohio Clinic is a non-profit healthcare center located in the state of Ohio. The clinic has a unique goal that combines clinical and hospital treatment with research and teaching. 
The medical centre employs a large workforce of 50,000 people, and as a consequence of their combined efforts, the medical facility has handled roughly 7 million visitors to date.
Dr. Judy, a clinic supervisor and pediatric surgeon at Ohio Clinic, was facing a third consecutive year of clinic losses. 
She had only recently been appointed to this position, but she was certain that the clinic was operating at peak efficiency. 
The fact that the hospital was losing money astonished her the most, despite having the best physicians available and plenty of planned appointments. 
She engaged a third-party agency to investigate the finance department in order to feel more secure about the finance side. 
The business, on the other hand, uncovered no proof relating to the problem at hand. 
With the recent shift in administration, however, attempts to make the medical facility self-sustaining have begun.
Due to the fact that it was the precise moment when I was given the role, this new endeavor by the management was a major challenge for me. 
I didn't have time to settle in, so it was a make-or-break situation for me. If there are no issues in the finances, appointments are increasing, and no significant hiring or increases have occurred, the only cause for this dilemma might be that people are not showing up after being scheduled in the first place.
A board meeting was coming up shortly, and she needed to gather information by then to explain the oddity. Despite the number of booked appointments, Dr. Judy recognized that theories and rumors would not help her figure out the cause of the losses.
She received the data dump of appointments to further examine her allegations, and she chose to utilize the data to confirm the proof. 
She recognized that concrete data isn't influenced by prejudice, therefore it would provide her a clear view of the problem. 
She had to first double-check if the dataset's characteristics were related to the topic at hand. As a result, she retrieved the data dictionary. 
Dr. Judy used the Internet to locate all of the necessary software tools for this investigation.
Dr. Judy hoped to use the metadata dump to perform the following:
1. Investigate why there are more losses despite the fact that the number of appointments is increasing.
2. If patients fail to show up for their planned appointments, devise a way to predict if a patient will show up based on his or her attributes. 
She felt that by understanding which patients were most likely to fail to show up, the hospital would be able to take preventative steps such as the following:
• Confirmations on a regular basis and send out appointment reminders and
• Adjust the number of physicians and hospital employees in accordance with the current need.
